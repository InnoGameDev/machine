# Machine Learning Roguelike



## Description

A small Roguelike game that uses Machine Learning to power its entities. Both the player and its enemies are ML Agents, and the demo is a good playground to test Machine Learning in a real game environment. A scene specifically for training is included, to demonstrate how to train the agents in a different environment than the one where the game is going to happen. This demo also features the use of Cinemachine for 2D and Tilemap.<br><br>
